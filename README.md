#### Problem Statement:

This assignment is a programming assignment wherein goal is to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

We are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions

'cnt' is the target variable and it indicates the number of bikes rented.

Based on the predicted co-efficients in the model, following features are contributing significantly.

•	temp ( coefficient = 0.3830 )
•	Weather situation – Light snow or rain (coefficient = -0.2453)
•	Year ( coefficient = 0.2369 )
